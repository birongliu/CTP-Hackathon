# Inspiration
Many people have a difficult time breaking into tech careers. Whether it be for Software Engineering, Data Science, or Product Management roles there exists a ton of consistent practice to get through the interview process and land a job. That’s why we built InterTech (pronounced like EnterTech) -- an AI powered-interview prep platform tailored to your needs and helps users improve upon their skills.
## What it does
InterTech is an AI-powered interview prep platform designed to help candidates practice both behavioral and technical interviews. Users can choose between two modes: in behavioral mode, the AI asks 3–5 common interview questions, records responses, and provides personalized feedback with a performance score; in technical mode, users get coding questions tailored to their career role and skill level, similar to LeetCode. The platform also stores past interviews so users can track progress over time. Our goal is to make interview prep smarter, more interactive, and tailored to each individual’s growth.
## How we built it
Frontend: React + TypeScript, React-bootstrap
Backend: Python + Flask
AI Agent: Ollama, LangGraph
Challenges we ran into
Connecting the Behavioral Backend to the Frontend
Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We have a working Behavioral backend that actually records and respond.
An aesthetic Frontend page built with React.
What we learned
Learning new technologies like TypeScript.
What’s next for InterTech
Implement the Technical part of the platform.
